     <br>

     <p> Lionel Messi is an Argentine former professional footballer counted amongst the best players in the world in football history. The
       only player in history to win five FIFA Ballons d'Or, he was also the first player to win three European Golden Shoes. During his
        playing career he shattered many world records and currently holds the records for most goals scored in La Liga, a La Liga season 
        (50), a calendar year (91), a single season (73), and a Champions League match (5), among several others. Born into a football-loving
         family in central Argentina, he developed a passion for the sport at an early age and spent his childhood playing football with his
          brothers.</p>
          <p> He joined the youth team of Newell’s Old Boys as a young boy and began playing for FC Barcelona’s under-14 team when he was 13.
             Having made his competitive debut as a 17 year old, Messi quickly established himself as an integral player for the Barcelona club.
           His first big success came in the 2008–09 season, during which he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football.</p>
           <p> Over the ensuing years he proceeded to establish himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer in official competitions and is also
             Argentina's all-time leading goalscorer with 55 goals in 112 matches. He retired in 2016 following Argentina's loss to Chile in the
           Copa América Centenario final. But, soon a campaign began to urge him to change his mind and Messi later on reversed his decision.</p>
